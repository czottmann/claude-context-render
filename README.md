# render-claude-context

Tired of maintaining several sets of context and rules for Claude Code, opencode, and Gemini CLI?

This node.js CLI tool processes CLAUDE.md files with hierarchical collection and recursive `@`-import resolution. Walks directory tree from current to `~/.claude/`, collecting all CLAUDE.md files and processing them with file import resolution. Saves processed context files with resolved imports next to the original CLAUDE.md files or in a specific location (configurable).

These files can then be used as context for Gemini or opencode.

## But why?

Claude Code uses `CLAUDE.md` files which provide context for the tool. From [Anthropic's docs](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices):

> You can place `CLAUDE.md` files in several locations:
>
> The root of your repo, or wherever you run `claude` from (the most common usage). Name it `CLAUDE.md` and check it into git so that you can share it across sessions and with your team [â€¦]
> Any parent of the directory where you run `claude`. This is most useful for monorepos, where you might run claude from `root/foo`, and have CLAUDE.md files in both `root/CLAUDE.md` and `root/foo/CLAUDE.md`. Both of these will be pulled into context automatically [â€¦]
> Your home folder (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`), which applies it to all your *claude* sessions

Other agentic tools, like **Gemini CLI** or **opencode**, work mostly the same way, but their expected file names are different (`GEMINI.md`, `AGENTS.md` etc.), and their home folder is not `~/.claude/`. Sure, I can make them read my `CLAUDE.md` files by adding that name to their settings (see [Gemini's docs about `contextFileName`](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/docs/cli/configuration.md#available-settings-in-settingsjson) or [opencode's docs on `instructions`](https://opencode.ai/docs/config/#instructions)), but that helps only partially â€“ because these tools differ in one big way:

They all read rule files in different ways.

For example, both Claude Code and Gemini can `@`-import other files, meaning they will replace `@./some/file.md` directives in their context file with the contents of the referenced file. But while Claude Code will happily import files from anywhere on your device, Gemini **only** allows files in the current directory. And opencode works in a different way still.

But I switch agents quite a bit, and it's cumbersome to copy and paste my rules and guidelines around.

So in order to streamline my dev environment, I decided to keep only my `CLAUDE.md`'s in order, and make Gemini and opencode play ball. **Now I only have to set up context once (for Claude) â€“ and have the other agents reuse it without me having to jump through hoops.**

## Showcase

### `create` - Generate context files with resolved imports

Note: _"Single collated file"_ means _"one output file that contains every processed CLAUDE.md from project up to global folder"_.

```bash
# Create individual files next to each CLAUDE.md (default behavior) from project up to global folder
# Uses: --output-folder origin (default), --filename CLAUDE-derived.md (default), 
#       --target gemini (default), commands included (default)
render-claude-context create

# Create single collated file in current project directory
# Uses: --filename CLAUDE-derived.md (default), --target gemini (default), commands included
render-claude-context create --output-folder project

# Create single collated file in global folder (~/.gemini/ for default gemini target)
# Uses: --filename CLAUDE-derived.md (default), --target gemini (default), commands included
render-claude-context create --output-folder global

# Use custom filename with default origin mode
# Uses: --output-folder origin (default), --target gemini (default), commands included
render-claude-context create --filename my-context.md

# Target OpenCode AI tool (sets global folder to ~/.config/opencode/)
# Uses: --output-folder origin (default), --filename CLAUDE-derived.md (default), commands included
render-claude-context create --target opencode

# Use custom global folder
# Uses: --output-folder origin (default), --filename CLAUDE-derived.md (default), commands included
render-claude-context create --global-folder ~/my-ai-configs/

# Skip appending commands from ~/.claude/commands/ directory
# Uses: --output-folder origin (default), --filename CLAUDE-derived.md (default), --target gemini (default)
render-claude-context create --no-add-commands

# Create single collated file in current project directory, using custom filename
# Uses: commands included (default)
render-claude-context create --output-folder project --filename project-context.md

# Global mode with custom filename and no commands
# Uses: --target gemini (default), global folder ~/.gemini/
render-claude-context create --output-folder global --filename full-context.md --no-add-commands
```

### `cleanup` - Remove generated context files

Works exactly like `create` but removes the files. Imagine that!

### `setup` - Register context file with AI tool for auto-loading

```bash
# Register default filename with default target (adds CLAUDE-derived.md to gemini settings)
# Uses: --filename CLAUDE-derived.md (default), --target gemini (default)
render-claude-context setup

# Register custom filename with default gemini target
# Uses: --target gemini (default)
render-claude-context setup --filename my-context.md

# Register default filename with OpenCode target (adds to opencode.json settings)
# Uses: --filename CLAUDE-derived.md (default)
render-claude-context setup --target opencode

# Register custom filename with OpenCode target
render-claude-context setup --target opencode --filename project-context.md
```

### `teardown` - Unregister context file from AI tool

Works exactly like `setup` but removes the settings.

## Output Folder Modes (`--output-folder` flag)

Note: _"Single collated file"_ means _"one output file that contains every processed CLAUDE.md from project up to global folder"_.

### `origin` (default)
- Creates individual files next to each `CLAUDE.md` in the directory hierarchy
- Special case: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` output goes to target's global folder
- Most flexible for development workflows

### `project`
- Creates single collated file in current working directory, containing all `CLAUDE.md` output from project folder on up, including `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- Good for project-specific context generation

### `global`
- Creates single collated file in target's global folder
- Best for persistent AI tool integration

## Examples

### For Gemini

```bash
# One-time setup, tells Gemini to use context files with that name
render-claude-context setup --filename CLAUDE-derived.md

# Every day use: Generate context files on the fly, call Gemini, then clean up
render-claude-context create
gemini
render-claude-context cleanup
```

### opencode, 0FG mode ("zero f's given")

```bash
# No prior "setup" necessary, just generate `AGENTS.md` on the fly
# ðŸš¨ THIS WILL OVERWRITE ANY EXISTING `AGENTS.md` FILES FROM PROJECT UP TO
# ðŸš¨ GLOBAL FOLDER 
render-claude-context create --filename AGENTS.md --target opencode
opencode
render-claude-context cleanup --filename AGENTS.md --target opencode
```

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g git@github.com:czottmann/render-claude-context.git
```

## Quick Build Commands

```bash
# See usage
render-claude-context help

# Create context files (default: next to each CLAUDE.md)
render-claude-context create

# Write all processed CLAUDE.md output from project folder up to `~/.claude/`
# into a single `my-context.md` file in default global folder (`~/.gemini/`).
render-claude-context create --output-folder global --filename my-context.md

# Create but write the processed version of the Claude file found in 
# `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` to a custom global folder
render-claude-context create --global-folder ~/Desktop/
render-claude-context cleanup --global-folder ~/Desktop/

# Gemini integration setup/teardown
render-claude-context setup --filename my-context.md --target gemini
render-claude-context teardown --filename my-context.md --target gemini
```
